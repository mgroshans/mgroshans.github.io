A couple years ago I decided I should have a website. After all I'm a software
developer, and software developers have websites. So I bought a domain...

It turns out that buying the domain was actually the easiest part. You see, the
gotcha for having a website is that most websites have stuff like `HTML` and
`CSS` maybe even `JavaScript`. And since I'm a software developer I can't just
have something as important as the source code of my _personal website_ written
by _someone else_. Using libraries to build the site is fine of course, but
certainly any "microblog" framework would be going to far. The logic there
is very sound I assure you.

Anyway an eager, younger version of myself quickly threw some [awesome
content](https://github.com/mgroshans/mgroshans.github.io/blob/9f392ea1fada8be3b8917f08a4d46c257769394f/index.html)
onto the website and called it a day.

Some months later I actually [started generating the
site](https://github.com/mgroshans/mgroshans.github.io/commit/04ad7f1ecd5d1287241d24fd6808fb85e9c783db).
I'm a big fan of `gulp` (this is actually true despite any other sarcasm) to
manage any set of repeated tasks, and building a website turns out to be a set
of repeated tasks. So using gulp to render my `HTML` and `CSS` was a no-brainer.
And obviously I need to render this stuff; if I wrote actual `HTML` and `CSS` by
hand I'd look like a software developer from the stone age. And of course I
don't need any `JavaScript` on a static website, but it's the natural choice for
rendering all the other that goes onto the website.

I did need to write something though, so I settled on `handlebars` templates for
the markup and `LESS` for the styling. It turns out though that `handlebars` is
pretty limiting even for something as limited as my blog with no content. This
caused a quick switch to `swig`. Of course I also added `markdown` support so I
could write posts while staying even farther from `HTML`. I was pretty happy
with that, but after all that work there wasn't any time left to add awesome
content, just some average [placeholder
content](https://github.com/mgroshans/mgroshans.github.io/blob/e7fb7cb91ce3506f6c77d89f20811396d626f8fd/posts/example-post.html).

Which actually brings this little story to the present day, where I'm writing
this. Because it's now been some months since I last did anything to the website
and the content hadn't changed since I added the average placeholder content.
But this time I actually managed to add some real content! This is the content!
Awesome! A blog about writing a blog. Look at how meta I am.

Oh and of course I still had to change _something_. So now the posts are no
longer `swig` templates (because that project is no longer maintained), rather
this post was rendered with `nunjucks` templates! Since both projects are
basically `jinja2` for `JavaScript` very little work was necessary, hooray!
